The first defect: it is not possible to add more than one product in one order
You mean : 1 Order Contain 1 Product only


The second defect: the Offer do not mean the current design, the truth is the same as adding a product model, but this is a by-product related to the main product.

For example, I am sending you a basic offer: a phone with specifications and such price, and two other offers related to the same phone but another company.
This is repeated with each product addition

discounts* i mean offer


This is one order that includes 10 products, for example, the same package system, and some products may contain offers

========================================================


1. what I understand now is .. 
The system I developed
	-can add more than one Product to an order .
 	-And Add One Or More than 1 Offer in a order Product.

 More Details:
 	parent: order
 		Order-Childs-Products: one or More than One Product
 			Order-Product-Child: No Offer, Or One Offer Or More Than One Offer (Here Offer Mean Give Discount or any advantege if SomeOne Buy This)


--> It is Wrong.

Correct Is::

One Order only can have One Product.
And Offer Mean same type of Order with 1 Product
That We can make a relation ..

Why??
So that, when we show the Order Product in the Front-end...
We may able to show some related Order Product with it (using That Relation)




For example, I am sending you a basic offer: a phone with specifications and such price, and two other offers related to the same phone but another company.
This is repeated with each product addition


You mean :

You are sending me a phone 
For example:

Parent::
Phone: Nokia
Model: 220
price: $300

You can buy Related Phone:

Childs::
a.
Phone: Xiami
Model: 330
Price: $300

b.
Phone: Motorolla
Model: 730
Price: $310

c.
Phone: Zte
Model: 641
Price: $290


-----------------------------------------
So In the Design I can 
Add A order and one product

For example:

Phone: Nokia
Model: 220
price: $300
-----------------------------------------
Then I Can relate the Phone NOKIA 
With: 
a. Phone: Xiami
b. Phone: Motorolla
c. Phone: Zte

(of Course, First we Need to Create:- a,b,c and then add the Relation with any Parent)
-----------------------------------

So that in the Front end When We show
Parent:: Nokia
It related Other Phone shows off
Childs::
a. Phone: Xiami
b. Phone: Motorolla
c. Phone: Zte

That's All
